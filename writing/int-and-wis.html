            <h1>
                <code>INT</code> and <code>WIS</code> in software development
            </h1>
            <p>
                We tend to think of software engineering as a discipline that
                requires a lot of smarts.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the popular imagination, the programmer is a paragon of
                nerds, gifted with a special intelligence that makes the inner
                workings of a computer open to them and inscrutable to everyone
                else. Even within the industry, we often treat software
                engineering problems as puzzles that only raw brainpower to
                solve. In this imagining, the most effective teams are made up
                of engineers who think harder and faster than anyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
                This feels wrong, however: first, because it misunderstands
                intelligence as something like horsepower in an engine, scaling
                linearly and applicable to any problem, and second, because
                experience shows that
                <em
                    >sometimes the smartest developers are the least
                    effective.</em
                >
            </p>
            <p>
                To understand why this might be the case, it helps to consider
                the difference between <strong>intelligence</strong> and
                <strong>wisdom</strong> – at least, as they&#39;re defined in
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons"
                    >Dungeons and Dragons</a
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="../images/dnd.gif" alt="image" class="writing-img" />
            </p>
            <p>
                The intersection of software engineers and Dungeons and Dragons
                players is large. But in case you spent more time outside than I
                did in middle school, I&#39;ll take a minute to explain.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the game every character has a set of core &quot;ability
                scores&quot; that determine how good they are at certain tasks.
                Characters can be strong or weak, nimble or clumsy, charismatic
                or repulsive, and so on, all based on these ability scores.
            </p>
            <p>
                What about a character&#39;s smarts? The game breaks this down
                into two ability scores. The first,
                <strong>intelligence</strong> (usually abbreviated
                <code>INT</code>), is defined as:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and
                    the ability to reason. An Intelligence check comes into play
                    when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or
                    deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation,
                    Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain
                    kinds of Intelligence checks.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This is more or less in line with how most of us would define
                &quot;smarts&quot;. Education, technical skill, and raw
                reasoning ability are all a part of this idea of intelligence.
                Just substitute &quot;arcana&quot; with writing a complicated
                regex from memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second ability, <strong>wisdom</strong> (abbreviated
                <code>WIS</code>), is a little different:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you
                    and represents perceptiveness and intuition. A Wisdom check
                    might reflect an effort to read body language, understand
                    someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or
                    care for an injured person.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                If intelligence is analytic and skillful, wisdom is intuitive
                and perceptive. A cornerstone of wisdom is
                <em>sound judgement</em>, which the game considers distinct from
                raw intelligence. Put in simpler terms, if intelligence informs
                <em>how</em> to solve a problem, wisdom helps determine
                <em>what</em> problems should be solved and <em>why</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A useful insight of the game is that it considers
                <code>INT</code> and <code>WIS</code> to be distinct skills.
                It&#39;s entirely possibly to have a character of average or
                even below average intelligence, but who is gifted with deep
                wisdom that allows them to consistently make the right choices.
                Casting out to the broader fantasy genre, Tolkein&#39;s Samwise
                Gamgee is a good example of a &quot;low <code>INT</code>, high
                <code>WIS</code>&quot; character.
            </p>
            <p>
                The inverse – a &quot;high <code>INT</code>, low
                <code>WIS</code>&quot; character – is so common in the sword and
                sorcery genre that it&#39;s become a trope. Imagine a wizard of
                fearsome intelligence and power, bending the world to his will
                with black magic. More often that not, these kinds of characters
                end up ensared in their own schemes, destroyed by their own
                hubris and magic spun out of control. Does that sound familiar?
            </p>
            <h2>Dangerous bit wizards</h2>
            <p>
                If you&#39;ve been in this business long enough, you&#39;ve
                encountered a software engineer who fits this trope.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some engineers are really, really smart. They learn faster, fit
                a lot of information in their heads, and can just do things that
                perfectly average engineers (like me) couldn&#39;t hope to do,
                at least not as easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pretty often however, these same engineers can&#39;t get out of
                their own way. Sometimes, in pursuit of an ideal solution, they
                bikeshed so long that they never get around to building
                anything. Or worse, they rush headlong into a solution without
                stopping to think, overestimating their ability to solve it on
                the fly. Often they design systems that are needlessly complex,
                and later find out that their clever approach has hidden
                problems, or is too costly to maintain. Habits that are bad
                enough when this kind of engineer works alone are made worse in
                a team context – if the brilliant engineer can barely manage
                what they&#39;ve built, how will their teammates do it?
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, this engineer has very high <code>INT</code> but not
                enough <code>WIS</code>. They have the smarts needed to wrestle
                with the most challenging problems, but they don&#39;t have the
                <em>judgement</em> to do it well.
            </p>
            <h2>Traps for smart people</h2>
            <p>
                Why does this happen? I think these wizards fall into a couple
                familiar traps.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong
                    >First, very smart engineers are often too comfortable with
                    complexity</strong
                >. If you&#39;re a simple
                <a href="https://grugbrain.dev/">grug brained developer</a> like
                me, you fear complexity. Complexity is the great enemy that
                inevitably accumulates in any piece of software once it reaches
                a certain age and size. Complexity slows us down by making our
                systems harder to change and reason about, and it decreases code
                quality by making it easier to introduce bugs and harder to
                detect them. Managing complexity means accepting necessary
                complexity while fighting <em>unnecessary</em> complexity
                wherever we can.
            </p>
            <p>
                When an engineer has high <code>INT</code> but low
                <code>WIS</code>, this fear of complexity is not as strongly
                developed. They&#39;re more comfortable with complexity because
                they can be better at managing it than other engineers – their
                personal threshold for &quot;too complex&quot; is just higher.
                Danger begins when this sense of comfort veers into
                overconfidence. An engineer who is too clever by half builds
                systems that are difficult to understand and work with. They set
                traps for themselves and others.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong
                    >Second, these engineers are likely to fall in the trap of
                    tool obsession.</strong
                >
                Most engineers are particular about the tools they use. They
                have preferred programming languages, coding paradigms, build
                systems, text editors, and so on. The smartest engineers can
                refine these preferences to an obsessive degree. This can be a
                good thing – some of the best tools emerged because passionate
                people were highly motivated to build them – but it can also
                become an unproductive distraction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most professional software organizations don&#39;t use the
                &quot;best&quot; tools. They&#39;re usually locked into a set of
                choices that are either impossible to change, or not worth the
                cost of changing. Managing a professional technology stack often
                comes down to choosing tools that are <em>good enough</em> for
                what a team needs to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                This compromise can make the smartest engineers very
                uncomfortable. They don&#39;t like being told to use
                technologies they deem inferior, and they assume the benefits of
                adopting their preferred tools will always outweigh the
                switching cost. They are often wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Years ago I worked for a company that originally ran on a crusty
                PHP monolith. To escape the hell that is modern PHP development,
                a faction of our engineering team adopted and heavily promoted
                <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)"
                    >Scala</a
                >
                as the foundation of an alternative technology stack. I like and
                still like Scala – learning it made me a better software
                engineer – but the wizards quickly started to lose control of
                their magic. A subset of my very smartest coworkers concluded it
                wasn&#39;t enough to switch languages, everyone had to relearn
                how to program from first principles. Knowledge of certain
                branchs of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory"
                    >advanced mathematics</a
                >
                was now required to build software the &quot;right&quot; way.
                Significant time and energy was spent building frameworks and
                porting old code to use the new patterns, which were intuitive
                only to a minority of engineers in the organization. In the
                meantime, another faction grew so frustrated that they adopted a
                completely different programming language which a much lower
                barrier to entry. That language was Typescript, now probably the
                industry&#39;s <em>lingua franca</em>, while Scala is relegated
                to a curiosity.
            </p>
            <p>
                This pattern is so common that it&#39;s a big part of what
                drives the technology hype cycle. Early adopters of any new tool
                are usually smart, opinionated, and the least likely to
                recognize the ways in which their tool may be flawed. In
                general, you should be wary of any technology trend whose
                boosters present it as the solution to almost
                <em>any</em> problem, rather than acknowledge that picking the
                right tool is <em>context dependent</em>. This is how high
                <code>INT</code>, low <code>WIS</code> engineering plays out at
                industry scale.
            </p>
            <h2>Cultivating wisdom</h2>
            <p>
                If there&#39;s any lesson to take from this, it&#39;s that raw
                technical skill is often not nearly as important as sound
                technical judgement. Both in game and in the real world, the
                most powerful wizards can be bested by simpler minds that make
                sounder choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                The good news is that while raw intelligence is often something
                you&#39;re just born with, wisdom is not an innate quality and
                can be cultivated. One of the key differences between late and
                early career software engineers is their depth of technical
                judgement, something that improves over years of making good
                (and bad) decisions and seeing what works.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you&#39;re lucky enough to be a very high
                <code>INT</code> software engineer, it&#39;s worth being honest
                with yourself and assess your <code>WIS</code>. Do you fit the
                trope of the dangerous bit wizard? Many of the smartest
                engineers start their careers in this mode, but the very best
                grow out of it as their wisdom matures. If, on the other hand,
                you&#39;re a mere mortal when it comes to <code>INT</code>,
                recognizing the importance of <code>WIS</code> can be a
                revelation. It makes it easier to resist the temptation to
                constantly compare yourself to the smartest engineers, which
                feeds
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"
                    >imposter syndrome</a
                >. Wisdom provides a clear path for growth that goes beyond mere
                technical mastery, and an escape from the stereotype that all
                programmers need to be wizards. It&#39;s just as rewarding to
                play as a wise monk.
