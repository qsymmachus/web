<p>Here are a two problems I ran into during my design phase that are helpful to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Floating an element removes it from the flow of the document â€“ it will behave as if it has no connection to the other elements. Changes to margin &amp; display attributes will not take effect.</li>
  <li>In order to center an element using margin: auto; , the following must be true: the element must have a set width, and the element must display as a block.</li>
</ol>
